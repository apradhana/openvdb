------------

1) Confirm quorum

Quorum is present.

2) Secretary

Secretary is Andre P.

3) Forum

[Issue 1618](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb/issues/1618)

NanoVDB Issue. Ken will take a look.

4) NanoVDB Update

We have one year of NanoVDB development to be submitted as a PR. We are slowly
taking out the restriction that NanoVDB grid cannot be modified. A few of the additions
include: moving to C++17, new way to construct a NanoVDB grid on the GPU, new
class to create NanoVDB grid called `CreateNanoGrid`.

5) Useful Idiom in NanoVDB

The update on NanoVDB includes a new idiom, where, a method in one of the Nodes
or one of the Accessors is templatized over an Operator and a variadic template
argument. The template operator is implemented as a struct with static methods
specializing over the different type of nodes. For example:

```
template <typename BuildT>
struct GetValue {
    __hostdev__ static auto get(const NanoRoot<BuildT>  &root, const typename NanoRoot<BuildT>::Tile *tile) {return tile ? tile->value : root.mBackground;}
    __hostdev__ static auto get(const NanoUpper<BuildT> &node, uint32_t n) {return node.mTable[n].value;}
    __hostdev__ static auto get(const NanoLower<BuildT> &node, uint32_t n) {return node.mTable[n].value;}
    __hostdev__ static auto get(const NanoLeaf<BuildT>  &leaf, uint32_t n) {return leaf.getValue(n);}// works with all build types
};// GetValue<BuildT>
```

This idiom leverages C++17 features. It is extendable and compact.

This idiom is better than what is currently implemented in OpenVDB it simplifies
the process of adding a new grid type or a new accessor.

6) VDB 11

The plan is for hole-removal PR to come before SIGGRAPH.

7) Next meeting

Next meeting is on May 2nd, 2023. 2pm-3pm EDT.
